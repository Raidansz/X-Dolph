Web Browser
---------------------------------------------
Hello friends,

This project is a web browser that runs on Windows operating systems. The programming language is Visual Basic.

This project has many bugs since it has not been updated and I do not have the intention to update it or even fix the bugs since I am no longer interested neither in this project nor in the programming language itself. I might recreate this project from scratch in the future using another programming language, but for now, I will stick to my projects that I am currently working on.

WHY DID I DEVELOPED THIS APP? 
In 2015, I was learning Visual Basic so I thought that it would be cool, if I create a project to apply what I was learning, but things changed and I felt that I am not into this programming language anymore.


Feel free to whatever you want with it.
